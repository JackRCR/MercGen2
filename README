-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a small console utility for generating a perscribed list of mercenaries in a neat and formatted fashion.  All information and numbers based off of the sheet "Hirelings_Mercenaries_Selling_Treasure_Equipment_Purchases_In_Settlements.pdf"

To operate the program, unzip the file and run MercenaryGenerator.exe
The program takes input in roman numeral (i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi) and (y, n).  NOT CASE SENSITIVE.

Will improve with time.
